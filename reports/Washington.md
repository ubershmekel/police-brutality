### Woman hit with police projectile resumes breathing after CPR, delivered to hospital | June 7th

Video shows an individual getting hit by a police projectile, falling down, and becoming unresponsive. Medics drag the person away from the police. A medic's first-hand narrative account describes the victim as "a young woman in her 20s." Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.
